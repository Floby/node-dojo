You may have noticed that he still haven't seen what our "webapp"
looks like. We can't even start it for anything else than testing !

Well, that's not the case anymore. You can now spin up your server
with the `npm start` command. I've set it up for you =)

If you need more options, you can also run `node bin/my-chat.js --help`

AND MORE ! I've created a very simple browser app that works with
your server. It lives in the /public and has quite a few files.

You need to serve that static content through your webserver.


As usual, do whatever's needed to make the test suite pass
